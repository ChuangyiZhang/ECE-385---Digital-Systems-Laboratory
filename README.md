# Computer Usage

At different times during the term students may use a Windows or Linux personal computer and the appropriate electronic design automation (EDA) tools to design and simulate digital circuits. During the last 11 weeks the students use a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) prototyping platform to design, simulate, program, and test their digital logic and system-on-chip circuits. 1. Nine experiments of increasing complexity covering first 10 topics. Groups of 2 students use a protoboard to build their circuits and an I/O lab station, oscilloscope, logic analyzer, and pulse generator to debug and demonstrate their experiments. FPGAs may be used in some experiments. 2. During the last 4 weeks, groups of 2 students choose, design, build, and debug a project using the FPGA hardware in conjunction with a system-on-chip platform software build environment.
